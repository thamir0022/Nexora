# ✨ Nexora Empowering Education Through Skills

**Nexora** is a full-featured, modern e-learning platform built with the mission to democratize access to high-quality, skill-based education.
Unlike traditional platforms, Nexora focuses on **hands-on, practical skills** especially those that are vanishing with time, 
such as weaving, stone carving, calligraphy, and other rare, heritage-rich artistic traditions that deserve to be preserved and passed on.  

🎯 **Core Vision**:  
To bridge the gap between passionate learners and talented instructors, empowering anyone to **learn from anywhere** and enabling skilled individuals to
**monetize their knowledge** while keeping valuable traditions alive. Nexora is not just a project it’s a **personal passion project** and the 
**first step toward a larger vision** to reimagine how we value, preserve, and spread meaningful skills through technology.
